                <h2>Oude Kerk (Old Church)</h2>
                <p>The Oude Kerk (Old Church) - built in 1306 and the city's oldest structure - remains unchanged since Rembrandt's time. The first hall church in North Holland, this splendid piece of architecture became the model for many other churches in the region.</p>

                <h2>Dam Square</h2>
                <p>Dam Square is one of the most tourist-packed areas of Amsterdam, and for good reason. Its most prominent feature is the 17th-century Royal Palace (Koninklijk Palace), former home of the Dutch royal family and present-day venue for royal functions.</p>

                <h2>Royal Palace of Amsterdam</h2>
                <p>Formerly the Town Hall, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam (Koninklijk Paleis van Amsterdam) serves as the King's residence when he's in the city. Its construction was a monumental task when started in 1648 and required the sinking of 13,659 piles to support the mammoth structure. Based upon the architecture of ancient Rome, the exterior is strictly classical, while the interior is magnificently furnished, its apartments decorated with a wealth of reliefs, ornamentation, marble sculptures, and friezes, along with ceiling-paintings by Ferdinand Bol and Govert Flinck, pupils of Rembrandt.</p>

                <h2>Rijksmuseum</h2>
                <p>One of Amsterdam's most popular attractions - and certainly its most important art repository - the Rijksmuseum (National Museum) was founded in 1798 to house the country's huge collection of rare art and antiquities. The museum's impressive collection includes a million cultural artifacts dating from the 13th century to the modern day, among them more than 8,000 important paintings spread across 250 rooms of this sprawling building.</p>
