    <h2>Public Transport Amsterdam</h2>
    <div class="one">
        <p class="trn">The public transport (PT) network in Amsterdam is impressively convenient to get around if you are familiar with it. The network includes metros, buses, trams, ferries and NS trains. There are a lot of different tickets to use Amsterdam’s public transport (PT). The PT chip card (ov chipkaart) is the most common card to travel with. This is a (chip) card where you travel on credits and pay per distance.  There are also paper tickets with an electronic chip  that range from one hour tickets to multiple day tickets. We understand that all these tickets might confuse you. Through this page we want to help visitors from all over the world to optimize their stay whatever the duration is.</p>

            <h2>Ferries in Amsterdam</h2>
            <p class="trn">North Amsterdam is separated from the centre by a large canal called: the IJ. The most convenient way of crossing this canal, both during the day and the night, is to take a ferry. Because there are a lot of ferries operating in a relatively short route you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes. Most of the ferries depart just outside the Amsterdam central station, other places to get on board are displayed below. The best thing about this service is that it is absolutely FREE!</p>
